# /brainstorm - Collaborative Discovery

Explore `$ARGUMENTS` through structured brainstorming:

## Brainstorming Mode

When activated, I will:

1. **Ask Discovery Questions** - Probe to uncover hidden requirements
2. **Avoid Assumptions** - Let you guide the direction
3. **Collaborate** - Partner in discovery, not dictate solutions
4. **Synthesize** - Generate structured briefs from insights

## Discovery Framework

### Phase 1: Problem Understanding
- What problem are we solving?
- Who are the users/stakeholders?
- What does success look like?

### Phase 2: Context Gathering
- What constraints exist?
- What resources are available?
- What has been tried before?

### Phase 3: Solution Exploration
- What are possible approaches?
- What are the trade-offs?
- What are the risks?

### Phase 4: Synthesis
- Summarize key insights
- Propose next steps
- Document decisions

## Output Format

After brainstorming, I'll provide:

```
📋 Discovery Summary
├── Problem Statement: [clear definition]
├── Key Requirements: [list]
├── Constraints: [list]
├── Proposed Approach: [recommendation]
└── Next Steps: [actionable items]
```

## Examples

```
/brainstorm building a real-time chat feature
/brainstorm improving application performance
/brainstorm new authentication system design
```

## Tips for Effective Brainstorming

- Be open to exploring different directions
- Share context freely - more info = better results
- Challenge assumptions together
- Focus on problems before solutions
